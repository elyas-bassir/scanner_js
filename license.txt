Invicti will indemnify, defend, and hold Customer harmless against any third party claim that the Software or Services infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of a third party held under the laws of the United States or the European Economic Area provided that Customer promptly notifies Invicti of any and all threats, claims, and proceedings related thereto and gives reasonable assistance and the opportunity for Invicti to assume sole control over defense and settlement.  Invicti will not be responsible for any settlement it does not approve, provided that any such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. The foregoing obligations do not apply with respect to the Invicti Solution or portions or components thereof (a) not created by Invicti; (b) modified by Customer after delivery by Invicti and without Invicti recommendation or authorization; (c) combined with other products, processes, or materials where the alleged infringement arises directly from such combination; (d) for which Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof by Invicti or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement; (e) where Customer's use of such Invicti Solution is not strictly in accordance with the Agreement and any Documentation; or (f) a Trial Version.  In the event of a claim, or if Invicti believes a claim is likely, Invicti may modify the Invicti Solution, obtain a license for Customer, or - if none of the foregoing is accomplished - terminate this Agreement and provide Customer with a pro-rata refund of any prepaid but unused fees.  This Section states Invicti's entire liability (and shall be Customer's sole and exclusive remedy) with respect to indemnification to Customer.

8.2  Indemnification by Customer.  Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold Invicti harmless from all damages, costs, settlements, attorneys' fees, and expenses related to any claim arising from (i) Customer Data, or (ii) Customer's use or distribution of the Invicti Solution, including any Trial Version or Beta Feature, in violation of this Agreement.

INVICTI'S AND ITS LICENSORS' LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE LICENSE FEES CUSTOMER PAID IN THE PAST TWELVE (12) MONTHS FOR THE INVICTI SOLUTION GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR $10,000. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER INVICTI OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  CUSTOMER MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MORE THAN EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES.

Recipient will protect the secrecy of and prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of Discloser's Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own confidential information and will in no event use less than reasonable care.  Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential Information if required by judicial or administrative process, provided that Recipient first provides Discloser with prompt notice of such required disclosure to enable the Discloser to seek a protective order.  Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement and Discloser's request, Recipient will promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) Discloser's Confidential Information.

14.  Miscellaneous.

Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder to a third party without the written consent of the other party, except that either party may, without such consent, assign or transfer this Agreement pursuant to a transfer of all or substantially all of such party's business and assets, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, or otherwise.  Any attempted assignment or transfer of this Agreement in contravention of the foregoing will be null and void.  Invicti reserves the right to terminate this Agreement in the event of Customer's assignment to an Invicti competitor.  A party is not liable under this Agreement for non-performance caused by events or conditions beyond that party's control if that party makes reasonable efforts to perform.  This provision does not relieve Customer of its obligation to make all payments due as detailed on an Order Form.  Invicti may update the terms of this Agreement from time to time in its sole discretion.  Invicti will provide Customer with written notice of any material change, and Customer's renewal of their Subscription following such updates constitutes acceptance of the same.  The provisions hereof are for the benefit of the parties only and not for any other person or entity.  Any notice, report, approval, authorization, agreement, or consent required or permitted hereunder will be in writing; notices will be sent to the address that the applicable party has or may provide by written notice or, if there is no such address, the most recent address the party giving notice can locate using reasonable efforts.  No failure or delay in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise.  If any provision will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this arrangement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  This Agreement will be deemed to have been made in, and will be construed pursuant to: (i) if Customer is located in North America, the laws of the state of Texas without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act; (ii) if Customer is located outside of North America, the laws of Malta without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.  Customers located in North America hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of both the state and/or federal courts of Texas, and Customers located outside of North America hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of Malta.  This is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter hereof and any waivers or amendments will be effective only if made in writing; however, any pre-printed or standard terms of any purchase order, confirmation, or similar form, even if signed by the parties after the effectiveness hereof, will have no force or effect.  The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will be entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs in connection with such action.
